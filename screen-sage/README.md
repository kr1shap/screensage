## **Overview**  

Screen Sage is a software designed to help users with their interviews. The software takes a position/role a person wants to apply to and generates questions that could potentially be asked during a pre-screening interview for the stated position. While running the program, five practice interview questions are generated by Cohere, and the user is prompted to type out their responses in the software. After the user answers all five questions, the software provides insightful and detailed feedback for each of the user's responses.

This was a project made for GenAI '25.
